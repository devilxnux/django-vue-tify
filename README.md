# Django ft Vue + Vuetify Boilerplate

This template attempt to alleviate developer burden to setup and configure full stack development using Django and Vue+Vuetify.

Why I choose Django:

- Fully furnished, battery included framework to kickstart your application faster.
- Pretty good balance between performance and features.
- Use Python, a language that emphasize on good programming practices and code readability.

Why I choose Vue:

- A simple and logically organized framework.
- Very good and concise documentation.
- Good performance.

Why I choose Vuetify:

- Big catalog of components.
- Very good documentation.
- Easy to customize.

## Project Lifecycle

### Setup

Please verify that you already have Node.js with `npm` installed and Python 3.5 with `pipenv` installed globally.

```bash
npm install
pipenv install
```

### Development phase

Run development server using

```bash
python ./manage.py runserver
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Run your tests

```bash
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files

```bash
npm run lint
```

## To-Dos

- [ ] Add `build` command to build client _(compile, minify, etc)_ and server files _(compile i18n, gather static files)_ then copy them in one place.
- [ ] Add more proper client startup file.
